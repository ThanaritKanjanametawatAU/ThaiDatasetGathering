Generated: 2025-06-12 14:12:37

## Method
1. **Pattern Detection**: Ultra-conservative interruption detection
2. **MetricGAN+ Enhancement**: Neural noise reduction
3. **160% Loudness Normalization**: RMS-based with soft limiting

## Dataset
- Source: GigaSpeech2 Thai Archives
- Language: Thai
- Samples processed: 50/50
- Success rate: 100.0%

## Results
- Average loudness achieved: 160.0%
- Interruptions detected: 0
- Processing time: 0.0 minutes
- Average per sample: 0.02 seconds

## Files
- Original: `sample_XX_original.wav`
- Processed: `sample_XX_processed_160.wav`

## Integration
This final method is ready for integration into the main pipeline.
All preprocessing maintains quality while achieving 160% loudness.
