# Critical Tasks Added for 10M+ Audio Processing Milestone

## Summary

Based on the milestone requirements and analysis of existing tasks, I've identified and added 8 critical tasks (Tasks 13-20) that are essential for achieving the goal of processing 10M+ audio samples with zero human intervention. These tasks are organized across Sprints 2-4 and address key gaps in the current implementation.

## Critical Gaps Addressed

### 1. **Voice Activity Detection (Task 13)**
- **Gap**: No explicit VAD implementation despite being mentioned in requirements
- **Impact**: Essential for accurate audio segmentation and silence removal at scale
- **Priority**: HIGH - Critical for 10M+ processing efficiency

### 2. **TOPSIS Quality Scoring (Task 14)**
- **Gap**: Key requirement for multi-criteria decision making not tasked
- **Impact**: Enables automated quality control without human intervention
- **Priority**: HIGH - Essential for zero human intervention goal

### 3. **Production Monitoring (Task 15)**
- **Gap**: No Prometheus metrics or observability infrastructure
- **Impact**: Cannot monitor or troubleshoot at production scale
- **Priority**: HIGH - Critical for production deployment

### 4. **GPU Memory Management (Task 16)**
- **Gap**: No sophisticated GPU memory handling for scale
- **Impact**: OOM errors and inefficient resource usage at scale
- **Priority**: HIGH - Critical for handling 10M+ samples

### 5. **Pipeline Orchestration (Task 17)**
- **Gap**: Airflow/Kubeflow integration mentioned but not tasked
- **Impact**: Cannot automate complex workflows at scale
- **Priority**: HIGH - Essential for production automation

### 6. **Model Management (Task 18)**
- **Gap**: No model versioning or A/B testing framework
- **Impact**: Cannot improve models systematically
- **Priority**: MEDIUM - Important for continuous improvement

### 7. **Edge Case Handling (Task 19)**
- **Gap**: No comprehensive edge case handling for dataset variability
- **Impact**: Manual intervention required for problematic samples
- **Priority**: HIGH - Critical for 10M+ dataset variability

### 8. **Cost Optimization (Task 20)**
- **Gap**: No cost management or optimization strategies
- **Impact**: Unsustainable costs at 10M+ scale
- **Priority**: HIGH - Essential for sustainable operations

## Sprint Organization

### Sprint 2: Advanced Audio Processing & Quality Enhancement
- **Focus**: Core processing improvements
- **Tasks**: 13 (Silero VAD), 14 (TOPSIS)
- **Outcome**: Robust audio processing with automated quality control

### Sprint 3: Scale & Production Infrastructure  
- **Focus**: Production-ready infrastructure
- **Tasks**: 15 (Monitoring), 16 (GPU Management), 17 (Orchestration), 18 (Model Registry)
- **Outcome**: Scalable, monitored, automated pipeline

### Sprint 4: Resilience & Optimization
- **Focus**: Handle edge cases and optimize costs
- **Tasks**: 19 (Edge Cases), 20 (Cost Optimization)
- **Outcome**: Resilient, cost-effective system

## Key Benefits

1. **Zero Human Intervention**: Automated quality scoring, edge case handling, and pipeline orchestration
2. **Production Scale**: GPU management, monitoring, and distributed processing for 10M+ samples
3. **Cost Efficiency**: Spot instances, resource optimization, and dynamic tuning
4. **Reliability**: Comprehensive error handling, recovery mechanisms, and monitoring
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Model versioning, A/B testing, and performance tracking

## Implementation Priority

### Must Have (Sprint 2-3)
- Task 13: Silero VAD Integration
- Task 14: TOPSIS Quality Scoring
- Task 15: Production Monitoring
- Task 16: GPU Memory Management
- Task 17: Pipeline Orchestration

### Should Have (Sprint 3-4)
- Task 19: Edge Case Handling
- Task 20: Cost Optimization

### Nice to Have (Sprint 3)
- Task 18: Model Registry and Versioning

## Success Metrics

1. **Processing Scale**: Successfully process 10M+ samples without manual intervention
2. **Quality Automation**: 100% automated quality decisions using TOPSIS
3. **Resource Efficiency**: <10% OOM errors, >80% GPU utilization
