# Requirement R01: Autonomous Audio Analysis Architecture

## Overview
Implement a sophisticated multi-stage architecture for autonomous audio analysis that combines traditional signal processing with deep learning approaches.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Programmable Feature Extraction Pipeline
- [ ] Real-time SNR estimation using Ephraim-Malah recursion
- [ ] Processing speed < 1ms per 30ms chunk
- [ ] Support for frame-wise analysis
- [ ] Essentia integration for production-grade processing

### 2. Hierarchical Decision-Making Framework
- [ ] Rapid spectral analysis using librosa
- [ ] Extract key features:
  - [ ] Spectral centroid (brightness indicator)
  - [ ] Spectral contrast (speech/music discrimination)
  - [ ] Zero-crossing rate (noisiness indicator)
- [ ] Feature computation < 5ms per second of audio

### 3. Silero VAD Integration
- [ ] Process audio < 1ms per chunk
- [ ] Support for 6000+ languages
- [ ] Model size < 2MB
- [ ] Confidence scores for voice activity

### 4. Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)
- [ ] TOPSIS method implementation
- [ ] Ridge regression for decision matrices
- [ ] Weighted scoring based on label entropy
- [ ] Configurable threshold-based decision trees

### 5. Intelligent Routing Logic
- [ ] SNR > 20dB + high spectral contrast → high-quality models
- [ ] Vehicular noise + SNR > 10dB → noise-robust models
- [ ] Dynamic model selection based on input characteristics
- [ ] Decision latency < 10ms

## Technical Implementation

```python
class AudioAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vad = SileroVAD()
        self.feature_extractor = LibrosaFeatureExtractor()
        self.snr_estimator = EphraimMalahSNR()
        self.decision_engine = TOPSISDecisionEngine()
    
    def analyze(self, audio: np.ndarray, sr: int) -> AnalysisResult:
        # Extract features in parallel
        features = {
            'snr': self.snr_estimator.estimate(audio, sr),
            'spectral': self.feature_extractor.extract(audio, sr),
            'vad': self.vad.detect(audio, sr),
            'quality_indicators': self.compute_quality_indicators(audio, sr)
        }
        
        # Make routing decision
        decision = self.decision_engine.decide(features)
        
        return AnalysisResult(features, decision)
```
