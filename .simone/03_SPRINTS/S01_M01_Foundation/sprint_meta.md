# Sprint: Foundation - Core Audio Processing Framework (S01)

## Sprint Goal
Establish the foundation for autonomous audio processing with core analysis capabilities and quality metrics.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Core audio analysis framework with modular design
- Basic quality metrics implementation (SNR, spectral analysis)
- Pattern detection system for identifying audio issues
- Automated issue categorization (noise, artifacts, quality drops)
- Foundation for autonomous decision-making based on audio characteristics

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- [ ] Core audio analysis modules implemented and tested
- [ ] Quality metrics calculator with SNR, spectral features, and basic measurements
- [ ] Pattern detection system identifying at least 5 common audio issues
- [ ] Issue categorization with confidence scores
- [ ] Unit tests achieving >90% coverage
- [ ] Integration tests passing for all core modules
- [ ] Documentation for framework architecture and APIs

## Sprint Tasks
1. [S01_T01: Design Core Audio Analysis Architecture](./S01_T01_Design_Core_Audio_Analysis_Architecture.md) - Modular plugin architecture with pipeline orchestration and Prometheus monitoring
2. [S01_T02: Implement Basic Audio Loader and Preprocessor](./S01_T02_Implement_Basic_Audio_Loader_and_Preprocessor.md) - Multi-format audio streaming with GPU acceleration and robust error handling
3. [S01_T03: Build SNR Calculator Module](./S01_T03_Build_SNR_Calculator_Module.md) - Multi-algorithm SNR calculation with VAD integration and real-time processing
4. [S01_T04: Develop Spectral Analysis Module](./S01_T04_Develop_Spectral_Analysis_Module.md) - STFT-based analysis with anomaly detection and GPU optimization
5. [S01_T05: Create Pattern Detection System](./S01_T05_Create_Pattern_Detection_System.md) - ML-based temporal/spectral pattern detection with streaming capabilities
6. [S01_T06: Build Issue Categorization Engine](./S01_T06_Build_Issue_Categorization_Engine.md) - Multi-label classification with severity assessment and remediation suggestions
7. [S01_T07: Implement Decision Framework Foundation](./S01_T07_Implement_Decision_Framework_Foundation.md) - Autonomous decision trees with weighted scoring and A/B testing framework
8. [S01_T08: Create Integration Tests and Documentation](./S01_T08_Create_Integration_Tests_and_Documentation.md) - CI/CD integration with comprehensive documentation and quality metrics

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- This sprint lays the groundwork for all subsequent autonomous processing capabilities
- Focus on extensibility and modularity for future enhancements
- Ensure metrics are comparable across different audio sources
