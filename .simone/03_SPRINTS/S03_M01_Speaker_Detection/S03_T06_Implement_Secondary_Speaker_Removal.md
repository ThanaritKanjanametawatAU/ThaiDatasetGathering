# Task S03_T06: Implement Secondary Speaker Removal

## Task Overview
Implement an advanced secondary speaker removal system that cleanly removes non-dominant speakers while preserving the primary speaker's voice quality and naturalness.

## Technical Requirements

### Core Implementation
- **Secondary Speaker Remover** (`processors/audio_enhancement/removal/secondary_speaker_remover.py`)
  - Source separation integration
  - Adaptive removal strategies
  - Quality preservation
  - Artifact minimization

### Key Features
1. **Removal Strategies**
   - Spectral subtraction
   - Source separation
   - Masking techniques
   - Neural enhancement

2. **Quality Preservation**
   - Primary speaker protection
   - Naturalness maintenance
   - Artifact prevention
   - Smooth transitions

3. **Adaptive Processing**
   - Overlap handling
   - Intensity adjustment
   - Context awareness
   - Fallback mechanisms

## TDD Requirements

### Test Structure
```
tests/test_secondary_speaker_remover.py
- test_clean_removal()
- test_quality_preservation()
- test_overlap_handling()
- test_artifact_detection()
- test_edge_cases()
- test_real_samples()
```

### Test Data Requirements
- Two-speaker recordings
- Multi-speaker samples
- Various overlap scenarios
- Quality assessment data

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Core Removal
```python
class SecondarySpeakerRemover:
    def __init__(self, method='separation', preserve_quality=True):
        self.method = method
        self.preserve_quality = preserve_quality
        self.separator = self._init_separator()
        
    def remove_secondary(self, audio, dominant_speaker_id):
        # Remove secondary speakers
        pass
    
    def adaptive_removal(self, audio, speaker_segments):
        # Context-aware removal
        pass
    
    def post_process(self, audio):
        # Clean up artifacts
        pass
```

### Phase 2: Advanced Techniques
- Deep learning models
- Multi-stage processing
- Perceptual optimization
- Real-time adaptation

### Phase 3: Integration
- Pipeline integration
- Quality monitoring
- Performance optimization
- Fallback handling

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ Secondary speaker reduction > 20dB
2. ✅ Primary speaker quality loss < 5%
3. ✅ No audible artifacts
4. ✅ Processing latency < 200ms
5. ✅ Graceful degradation

## Example Usage
```python
from processors.audio_enhancement.removal import SecondarySpeakerRemover

# Initialize remover
remover = SecondarySpeakerRemover(method='separation', preserve_quality=True)

# Remove secondary speakers
cleaned_audio = remover.remove_secondary(
    audio_data, 
    dominant_speaker_id='SPEAKER_01'
)

# Adaptive removal with context
result = remover.adaptive_removal(audio_data, diarization_segments)
print(f"Removal quality: {result.quality_score:.2f}")
print(f"Artifacts detected: {result.artifacts}")

# Post-process for quality
final_audio = remover.post_process(cleaned_audio)

# Get removal statistics
stats = remover.get_statistics()
print(f"Secondary speaker attenuation: {stats.attenuation:.1f} dB")
print(f"Primary speaker preservation: {stats.preservation:.1f}%")
```

## Dependencies
- SpeechBrain for separation
- PyTorch for neural models
- NumPy for processing
- SciPy for filtering
- Librosa for audio analysis

## Performance Targets
- Processing speed: > 10x real-time
- Memory usage: < 500MB
- Quality preservation: > 95%
- Artifact rate: < 1%

## Notes
- Prioritize naturalness over complete removal
- Handle edge cases gracefully
- Support for confidence-based processing
- Enable quality vs. removal trade-offs
