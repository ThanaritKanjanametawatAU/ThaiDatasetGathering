## Task Overview
Create a sophisticated overlap detection module that identifies and characterizes simultaneous speech from multiple speakers, enabling better handling of overlapping speech segments.

## Technical Requirements

### Core Implementation

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Core Detection
```python
class OverlapDetector:
    def __init__(self, method='neural', threshold=0.5):
        self.method = method
        self.threshold = threshold
        self.model = self._load_model()
        
    def detect_overlaps(self, audio):
        # Detect overlapping speech regions
        pass
    
    def analyze_overlap(self, audio, start, end):
        # Detailed overlap analysis
        pass
    
    def get_overlap_mask(self, audio):
        # Binary mask of overlap regions
        pass
```

### Phase 2: Advanced Analysis
- Deep learning models
- Multi-modal detection
- Cross-correlation analysis
- Attention mechanisms

### Phase 3: Integration
- Real-time detection
- Diarization integration
- Separation triggering
- Quality assessment

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ Detection accuracy > 90%
2. ✅ False positive rate < 5%
3. ✅ Boundary accuracy within 50ms
4. ✅ Support for 3+ simultaneous speakers
5. ✅ Real-time processing capability

## Example Usage
```python
from processors.audio_enhancement.detection import OverlapDetector

# Initialize detector
detector = OverlapDetector(method='neural', threshold=0.5)

# Detect overlaps
overlaps = detector.detect_overlaps(audio_data)

for overlap in overlaps:
    print(f"Overlap: {overlap.start:.2f}s - {overlap.end:.2f}s")
    print(f"Confidence: {overlap.confidence:.2f}")
    print(f"Speakers: {overlap.num_speakers}")
    
# Get detailed analysis
analysis = detector.analyze_overlap(audio_data, start=5.0, end=5.5)
print(f"Dominant speaker: {analysis.dominant_speaker}")
print(f"Energy ratio: {analysis.energy_ratio:.2f}")

# Visualize overlaps
overlap_mask = detector.get_overlap_mask(audio_data)
plt.plot(overlap_mask)
plt.ylabel('Overlap Probability')
plt.show()
```

## Dependencies
- PyTorch for neural models
- Librosa for audio analysis
- NumPy for computations
- SciPy for signal processing
- Matplotlib for visualization

## Performance Targets
- Detection speed: > 50x real-time
- Latency: < 100ms
- Memory usage: < 200MB
- GPU utilization: < 50%

## Notes
- Consider cultural speaking patterns
- Handle interruptions vs. backchannels
- Support for different overlap types
- Enable confidence calibration
