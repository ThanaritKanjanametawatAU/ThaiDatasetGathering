# Task S05_T07: Build Coverage Monitor

## Task Overview
Build a comprehensive coverage monitoring system that tracks test coverage, audio scenario coverage, and enhancement quality coverage across the entire system.

## Technical Requirements

### Core Implementation
- **Coverage Monitor** (`tests/coverage/coverage_monitor.py`)
  - Code coverage tracking
  - Scenario coverage analysis
  - Quality coverage metrics
  - Gap identification

### Key Features
1. **Coverage Types**
   - Code/branch coverage
   - Audio scenario coverage
   - Quality metric coverage
   - Edge case coverage

2. **Monitoring Features**
   - Real-time tracking
   - Historical trends
   - Gap analysis
   - Priority recommendations

3. **Reporting Tools**
   - Coverage dashboards
   - Heat maps
   - Trend charts
   - Gap reports

## TDD Requirements

### Test Structure
```
tests/test_coverage_monitor.py
- test_code_coverage_tracking()
- test_scenario_coverage()
- test_quality_coverage()
- test_gap_analysis()
- test_trend_tracking()
- test_report_generation()
```

### Test Data Requirements
- Coverage data
- Test execution logs
- Scenario definitions
- Historical metrics

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Core Monitor
```python
class CoverageMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.code_tracker = CodeCoverageTracker()
        self.scenario_tracker = ScenarioCoverageTracker()
        self.quality_tracker = QualityCoverageTracker()
        
    def track_coverage(self, test_results):
        # Track all coverage types
        pass
    
    def analyze_gaps(self, target_coverage=90):
        # Identify coverage gaps
        pass
    
    def generate_recommendations(self, gaps):
        # Prioritize coverage improvements
        pass
```

### Phase 2: Advanced Monitoring
- ML-based gap prediction
- Intelligent test generation
- Coverage optimization
- Risk-based prioritization

### Phase 3: Integration
- CI/CD integration
- Real-time dashboards
- Alert systems
- Automated reporting

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ Track 5+ coverage dimensions
2. ✅ Real-time coverage updates
3. ✅ Gap detection accuracy > 95%
4. ✅ Actionable recommendations
5. ✅ Historical trend analysis

## Example Usage
```python
from tests.coverage import CoverageMonitor

# Initialize monitor
monitor = CoverageMonitor()

# Track coverage from test run
coverage_data = monitor.track_coverage(test_results)

print(f"Coverage Summary:")
print(f"Code coverage: {coverage_data.code_coverage:.1f}%")
print(f"Branch coverage: {coverage_data.branch_coverage:.1f}%")
print(f"Scenario coverage: {coverage_data.scenario_coverage:.1f}%")
print(f"Quality coverage: {coverage_data.quality_coverage:.1f}%")

# Analyze gaps
gaps = monitor.analyze_gaps(target_coverage=90)
print(f"\nCoverage Gaps:")
for gap in gaps:
    print(f"- {gap.area}: {gap.current:.1f}% (target: {gap.target}%)")
    print(f"  Missing: {gap.description}")
    print(f"  Priority: {gap.priority}")

# Get recommendations
recommendations = monitor.generate_recommendations(gaps)
print(f"\nTop Recommendations:")
for i, rec in enumerate(recommendations[:5], 1):
    print(f"{i}. {rec.action}")
    print(f"   Impact: +{rec.coverage_impact:.1f}% coverage")
    print(f"   Effort: {rec.effort_estimate}")

# Scenario coverage details
scenario_coverage = monitor.get_scenario_coverage()
print(f"\nScenario Coverage:")
for scenario, coverage in scenario_coverage.items():
    print(f"- {scenario}: {coverage:.1f}%")

# Generate visual report
monitor.generate_coverage_report(
    output_path='coverage_report.html',
    include_trends=True
)
```

## Dependencies
- Coverage.py for code coverage
- Pandas for data analysis
- Plotly for visualizations
- NumPy for calculations
- Jinja2 for reporting

## Performance Targets
- Coverage calculation: < 5 seconds
- Gap analysis: < 2 seconds
- Report generation: < 10 seconds
- Memory usage: < 200MB

## Notes
- Consider mutation testing coverage
- Track coverage by contributor
- Support for custom coverage metrics
- Enable coverage goals setting
