# Task S02_T05: Create Quality Threshold Manager

## Task Overview
Create a dynamic quality threshold management system that defines, monitors, and enforces quality standards throughout the audio enhancement pipeline.

## Technical Requirements

### Core Implementation
- **Threshold Manager** (`processors/audio_enhancement/quality/threshold_manager.py`)
  - Dynamic threshold configuration
  - Multi-level quality gates
  - Adaptive threshold adjustment
  - Profile-based management

### Key Features
1. **Threshold Profiles**
   - Production quality thresholds
   - Development/testing thresholds
   - Dataset-specific thresholds
   - Use-case based profiles

2. **Dynamic Adjustment**
   - Percentile-based thresholds
   - Historical performance tracking
   - Automatic threshold tuning
   - Outlier detection

3. **Quality Gates**
   - Pre-enhancement validation
   - Post-enhancement verification
   - Multi-stage checkpoints
   - Fail-fast mechanisms

## TDD Requirements

### Test Structure
```
tests/test_threshold_manager.py
- test_threshold_profile_loading()
- test_quality_gate_enforcement()
- test_dynamic_adjustment()
- test_multi_metric_thresholds()
- test_threshold_violation_handling()
- test_adaptive_learning()
```

### Test Data Requirements
- Various quality distributions
- Historical performance data
- Edge case audio samples
- Profile configurations

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Core Manager
```python
class QualityThresholdManager:
    def __init__(self, profile='production'):
        self.profile = profile
        self.thresholds = self._load_profile(profile)
        self.history = []
    
    def check_quality(self, metrics):
        # Check if metrics meet thresholds
        pass
    
    def update_thresholds(self, performance_data):
        # Adaptive threshold adjustment
        pass
    
    def get_quality_gate(self, stage):
        # Get thresholds for specific stage
        pass
```

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
- Machine learning for threshold optimization
- Anomaly detection algorithms
- Multi-objective threshold balancing
- Real-time threshold monitoring

### Phase 3: Integration
- Pipeline integration points
- Dashboard visualization
- Alert system for violations
- Configuration management UI

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ Support for 10+ quality metrics
2. ✅ Dynamic threshold adjustment based on performance
3. ✅ Multiple profile management
4. ✅ Real-time quality monitoring
5. ✅ Integration with enhancement pipeline

## Example Usage
```python
from processors.audio_enhancement.quality import QualityThresholdManager

# Initialize manager
manager = QualityThresholdManager(profile='production')

# Check quality
metrics = {
    'pesq': 3.5,
    'stoi': 0.85,
    'si_sdr': 15.2,
    'snr': 25.0
}

result = manager.check_quality(metrics)
if not result.passed:
    print(f"Quality check failed: {result.failures}")

# Update thresholds based on performance
manager.update_thresholds(historical_metrics)

# Get stage-specific thresholds
pre_enhance_thresholds = manager.get_quality_gate('pre_enhancement')
post_enhance_thresholds = manager.get_quality_gate('post_enhancement')
```

## Dependencies
- NumPy for statistical operations
- Pandas for data management
- Scikit-learn for adaptive algorithms
- YAML/JSON for configuration
- Logging framework

## Performance Targets
- Threshold check: < 1ms per metric
- Profile loading: < 10ms
- Adaptive update: < 100ms
- Memory usage: < 50MB

## Notes
- Consider different thresholds for different use cases
- Implement gradual threshold changes
- Support for weighted metric combinations
- Enable threshold explanation/justification
