        self.learner = ContinualLearner()
        
    def learn_from_experience(self, input_data, output_data, metrics):
        # Learn from processing experience
        pass
    
    def extract_patterns(self, min_confidence=0.8):
        # Extract successful patterns
        pass
    
    def update_models(self, batch_size=32):
        # Update enhancement models
        pass
```

## Example Usage
```python
from processors.audio_enhancement.learning import SelfLearningSystem

# Initialize system
learner = SelfLearningSystem(learning_mode='online')

# Process and learn
for audio in audio_stream:
    # Enhance audio
    enhanced = enhance_audio(audio)
    metrics = evaluate_quality(enhanced)
    
    # Learn from experience
    learner.learn_from_experience(
        input_data=audio,
        output_data=enhanced,
        metrics=metrics
    )
    
    # Periodic model update
    if learner.should_update():
        improvements = learner.update_models()
        print(f"Model updated: {improvements}")

# Extract learned patterns
patterns = learner.extract_patterns(min_confidence=0.85)
print(f"Discovered {len(patterns)} reliable patterns")

for pattern in patterns[:5]:
    print(f"\nPattern: {pattern.name}")
    print(f"Applicability: {pattern.conditions}")
    print(f"Success rate: {pattern.success_rate:.2f}")
    print(f"Average improvement: {pattern.avg_improvement:.1f}%")

# Generate insights
insights = learner.generate_insights()
print(f"\nKey insights:")
for insight in insights:
    print(f"- {insight}")
```
