# Sprint S02: Advanced Audio Processing & Quality Enhancement

## Sprint Overview
Implement advanced audio processing capabilities with automated quality assessment and voice activity detection for efficient 10M+ sample processing.

## Sprint Goals
- Integrate Silero VAD for intelligent audio segmentation
- Implement TOPSIS multi-criteria quality scoring system
- Enable automated quality-based processing decisions
- Achieve zero human intervention in quality control

## Sprint Tasks

### Task 13: Silero VAD Integration
**Enhanced Description:** GPU-accelerated Silero VAD with batch processing, Thai speech optimization, and intelligent chunking for 10M+ samples

### Task 14: TOPSIS Multi-Criteria Decision Making
**Enhanced Description:** TOPSIS quality scoring with adaptive thresholds, quality-based processing, and automated sample exclusion

## Success Criteria
- VAD correctly identifies speech segments with >95% accuracy
- TOPSIS scoring correlates with human perception on validation set
- Automated quality thresholds adapt to dataset characteristics
- Processing speed exceeds 1000 files per minute on GPU
- Zero human intervention required for quality decisions

## Dependencies
