# Sprint S07: Audio Enhancement Integration & Production Readiness

## Sprint Overview
Integrate the proven Patternâ†’MetricGAN+ â†’ 160% loudness enhancement method into the main preprocessing pipeline as a native enhancement level, with comprehensive quality validation, monitoring integration, and production readiness for enterprise-scale deployment.

## Sprint Goals
- Integrate Patternâ†’MetricGAN+ â†’ 160% loudness as native enhancement level in main pipeline
- Implement comprehensive configuration management and CLI integration for seamless access
- Deploy robust quality validation framework maintaining 37 tests passing standard
- Enable production-ready monitoring with real-time metrics and operational support

## Sprint Tasks

### Task 21: Core Patternâ†’MetricGAN+ Integration
**Enhanced Description:** Integrate Patternâ†’MetricGAN+ â†’ 160% loudness enhancement into main audio processing framework with BaseProcessor pattern compliance, Factory pattern integration, Strategy pattern implementation for dynamic enhancement selection, and comprehensive MetricGAN+ model integration with existing loudness normalization infrastructure

### Task 22: Configuration CLI Integration for Patternâ†’MetricGAN+ Enhancement  
**Enhanced Description:** Full configuration management system integration with centralized config pattern compliance, CLI argument parsing extension, environment variable support, schema validation implementation, and backward compatibility assurance for all existing enhancement levels and dataset processors

### Task 23: Quality Validation and Testing Framework
**Enhanced Description:** Comprehensive TDD-compliant testing framework with Patternâ†’MetricGAN+ specific quality metrics, edge case validation, performance benchmarking, integration testing with existing test suite, and quality threshold validation ensuring SI-SDR â‰¥8.0 dB, PESQ â‰¥3.2, STOI â‰¥0.87 standards

### Task 24: Monitoring Integration and Production Readiness
**Enhanced Description:** Enterprise-grade monitoring integration with real-time dashboard updates, performance tracking, error handling with graceful degradation, circuit breaker protection, health check endpoints, automated alerting, and comprehensive operational documentation for production deployment

## Success Criteria
- Patternâ†’MetricGAN+ accessible via `--enhancement-level pattern_metricgan_plus` CLI option
- All dataset processors support new enhancement level with full streaming compatibility
- Quality metrics consistently achieve 160.0% loudness with 0.0% standard deviation
- Performance maintains >2 samples/minute throughput with <100ms latency per sample
- Test suite maintains 37+ tests passing standard with new Patternâ†’MetricGAN+ tests
- Real-time monitoring dashboard displays Patternâ†’MetricGAN+ processing metrics and alerts
