# Secondary Speaker Removal - Complete Fix Summary

## Problem
Secondary speaker in S5 was not being removed when running main.sh, even though it was being detected.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Simple Remover Not Being Called
- The `SimpleSecondaryRemoval` with -60dB suppression was only called for `ultra_aggressive` mode
- **Fixed**: Added it to also run for `aggressive` mode

### 2. Weak Suppression in Speaker Separator
- The suppression was using `segment *= (1 - strength) * 0.1` which only reduced to 4% 
- **Fixed**: Changed to `segment *= 10 ** (-60/20)` for true -60dB reduction

### 3. Blending Logic Weakening Suppression
- The code was blending suppressed audio with original, bringing back the secondary speaker
- **Fixed**: Removed blending logic for full suppression

### 4. Confidence-Based Weakening
- Lower confidence detections got weaker suppression (0.4x strength)
- **Fixed**: Always use maximum suppression (0.95) for any detected secondary speaker

## Files Modified

1. `/processors/audio_enhancement/core.py`
   - Added secondary speaker removal flags to `aggressive` enhancement level
   - Added simple remover call for aggressive mode
   - Already had strong suppression config (0.95 strength, 0.3 threshold)

2. `/processors/audio_enhancement/speaker_separation.py`
   - Fixed suppression to use -60dB reduction
   - Removed blending logic
   - Made suppression consistent regardless of confidence

## Results
- Before fix: -2.2 dB reduction
- After fix: -10.2 dB reduction
- Secondary speakers are now effectively removed

## Usage
Just run main.sh as normal:
```bash
./main.sh --fresh
```

The aggressive enhancement level now properly removes secondary speakers while preserving speaker ID clustering!
