### Key Features

1. **Modular Architecture**
   - Each dataset processor is implemented as a separate class
   - Common interface for all processors
   - Easy to add new dataset sources

2. **Flexible Processing Modes**
   - Fresh creation mode (`--fresh`)
   - Incremental append mode (`--append`)
   - Sample mode for testing (`--sample`)

3. **Robust Error Handling**
   - Detailed logging
   - Checkpointing for resuming interrupted processing
   - Validation of samples against standard schema

4. **Standardized Schema**
   - ID: Sequential identifiers (S1, S2, S3, ...)
   - Language: "th" for Thai
   - audio: Audio file data
   - transcript: Transcript of the audio
   - length: Duration of the audio in seconds

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Testing**
   - Implement tests for validating the combined dataset
   - Test resume functionality with real data

2. **Real Data Processing**
   - Process real datasets and upload to Huggingface
   - Monitor performance and optimize as needed

3. **Future Enhancements**
   - Add more dataset sources
   - Implement audio quality filtering
   - Add data augmentation options
   - Implement parallel processing for faster execution
