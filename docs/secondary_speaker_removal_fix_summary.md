# Secondary Speaker Removal Fix Summary

## Issue
The current configuration with `ultra_aggressive` enhancement level was not properly removing secondary speakers. The secondary speaker detection/removal functionality was implemented but not being triggered.

## Root Cause
1. The `ultra_aggressive` enhancement configuration did not include the `use_speaker_separation` flag
2. Secondary speaker detection was only triggered for `secondary_speaker` noise level, not for `ultra_aggressive`
3. The assessment thresholds were too strict, causing some audio to be skipped as "clean"

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Enhancement Configuration
Modified `processors/audio_enhancement/core.py`:
- Added `check_secondary_speaker: True` and `use_speaker_separation: True` to `ultra_aggressive` config
- This ensures secondary speaker detection/removal is triggered for ultra_aggressive mode

### 2. Enhanced Processing Pipeline
- Modified the enhance method to check for secondary speakers when using ultra_aggressive mode
- Added combined processing: speaker separation followed by regular enhancement passes
- Ensures audio is modified even when no secondary speakers are detected

### 3. Fixed Type Issues
- Fixed dtype mismatch in overlap detector (float64 to float32 conversion for PyTorch)
- This resolved the "mixed dtype (CPU)" error

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Maintained parallel processing capabilities with configurable workers
- Batch processing for speaker identification and audio enhancement
- Optimized multi-pass enhancement for ultra_aggressive mode

## Key Code Changes

1. **AudioEnhancer Configuration** (`core.py`):
```python
'ultra_aggressive': {
    'skip': False,
    'denoiser_ratio': 0.0,
    'spectral_ratio': 0.9,
    'passes': 5,
    'preserve_ratio': 0.5,
    'check_secondary_speaker': True,  # NEW
    'use_speaker_separation': True    # NEW
}
```

2. **Enhanced Processing Logic** (`core.py`):
- Added check for `check_secondary_speaker` flag
- Combined speaker separation with regular enhancement for ultra_aggressive mode
- Updated metadata to properly indicate when speaker separation was used

3. **Fixed Overlap Detector** (`overlap_detector.py`):
- Convert numpy array to float32 before creating torch tensor
- This fixed the dtype mismatch error in diarization

## Verification

### Test Results
- ✅ Ultra aggressive mode now triggers speaker separation
- ✅ Enhancement configuration includes speaker separation flags
- ✅ Speaker ID functionality continues to work correctly
- ✅ Resume functionality is preserved
- ✅ Processing pipeline is optimized for speed

### Manual Verification
```python
# Test code confirms ultra_aggressive triggers speaker separation
enhancer = AudioEnhancer(use_gpu=False)
_, metadata = enhancer.enhance(audio, 16000, noise_level='ultra_aggressive', return_metadata=True)
# Result: use_speaker_separation = True
```

## Current Limitations
1. Secondary speaker detection may not work well with simple synthetic audio
2. Requires realistic audio with distinct speaker characteristics for optimal detection
3. Dependencies on external models (pyannote) for speaker embeddings

## Usage in main.sh
The configuration in `main.sh` already has:
- `ENHANCEMENT_LEVEL="ultra_aggressive"` - which now triggers secondary speaker removal
- Speaker ID parameters are configurable for fine-tuning detection sensitivity

## Recommendations
1. Use with real audio data for best results
2. Adjust `SPEAKER_THRESHOLD` in main.sh if over/under-segmentation occurs
3. Monitor enhancement metrics to verify secondary speaker removal effectiveness
