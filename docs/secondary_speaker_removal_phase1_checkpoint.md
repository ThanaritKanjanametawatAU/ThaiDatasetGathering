# Secondary Speaker Removal - Phase 1 Checkpoint

## Date: 2025-06-04

### Completed Tasks

#### Task 1.1: Configuration Fix ✓
- Modified `processors/audio_enhancement/core.py`
- Added `check_secondary_speaker: True` and `use_speaker_separation: True` to ultra_aggressive mode
- This enables the secondary speaker removal pipeline for ultra_aggressive enhancement level

#### Task 1.2: Enhance Detection ✓
- Modified `processors/audio_enhancement/detection/overlap_detector.py`
- Integrated PyAnnote OSD (Overlapped Speech Detection) model
- Added `_initialize_osd()` method to initialize the OSD pipeline
- Added `_osd_detection()` method for detecting overlapped speech regions
- OSD detection now runs first in the detection pipeline for highest accuracy

#### Task 1.3: Strengthen Separation ✓
- Enhanced `processors/audio_enhancement/simple_secondary_removal.py`
- Added aggressive spectral masking with `_apply_aggressive_spectral_masking()` method
- Spectral masking applies frequency-selective suppression to detected secondary speaker regions
- Uses STFT/iSTFT for spectral domain processing
- Suppression parameters already strengthened in core.py (0.95 suppression, 0.5 similarity threshold)

### Test Results

- Tested with 20 samples from GigaSpeech2 and ProcessedVoiceTH datasets
- **65% of samples (13/20)** detected as having secondary speakers
- PESQ scores: 2.23 - 4.46 (good perceptual quality)
- STOI scores: 0.94 - 0.999 (excellent intelligibility)
- Processing time: 0.69 - 2.0 seconds per sample

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed `UnboundLocalError` in `main.py` line 912 (total_duration_hours referenced before assignment)

### Next Phase: Advanced Separation Models
- Phase 2 will integrate SepFormer/Conv-TasNet models for higher quality separation
- Implement exclusion logic for failed separations
- Add post-processing for artifact removal

### Commit Hash
- Phase 1 implementation: 1881bb5
