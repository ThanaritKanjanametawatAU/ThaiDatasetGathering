# Multi-Dataset Checkpoint and Resume Analysis

## Answer to Your Question

**YES**, the current implementation **DOES** support resuming across multiple datasets correctly. Here's how it works:

### How Checkpoints Work for Multiple Datasets

1. **Individual Checkpoints**: Each dataset maintains its own checkpoint file:
   - `GigaSpeech2_unified_checkpoint.json`
   - `MozillaCommonVoice_unified_checkpoint.json` (referred to as MozillaCV internally)
   - `ProcessedVoiceTH_unified_checkpoint.json`

2. **What Happens in Your Scenario**:
   ```
   python main.py --all --streaming --enable-stt
   # Processing order: GigaSpeech2 → MozillaCV → ProcessedVoiceTH
   
   # If interrupted during MozillaCV:
   # - GigaSpeech2: ✓ Complete (checkpoint shows all samples processed)
   # - MozillaCV: ⚡ Partial (checkpoint shows progress up to interruption)
   # - ProcessedVoiceTH: ⏸ Not started (no checkpoint)
   
   # When you run with --resume:
   python main.py --all --streaming --enable-stt --resume
   # - GigaSpeech2: Skipped (checkpoint indicates completion)
   # - MozillaCV: Resumes from last checkpoint position
   # - ProcessedVoiceTH: Starts fresh
   ```

### Key Implementation Details

1. **Checkpoint Storage** (`processors/base_processor.py`):
   - Each processor saves its own checkpoint in `save_streaming_checkpoint()`
   - Checkpoint includes:
     - `samples_processed`: Total samples processed
     - `current_split`: Current split being processed
     - `split_index`: Position within the split
     - `dataset_specific`: Custom data (e.g., archive index for GigaSpeech2)

2. **Resume Logic** (`main.py:338`):
   ```python
   # Get checkpoint if resuming
   checkpoint_file = get_checkpoint_file(args, dataset_name) if args.resume else None
   ```
   - Each dataset gets its own checkpoint file
   - The `process_all_splits()` method handles resuming from checkpoint

3. **Skip Logic** (`processors/base_processor.py:224-229`):
   ```python
   # Skip splits before the checkpoint split
   if should_skip and split != skip_until_split:
       self.logger.info(f"Skipping split: {split} (before checkpoint)")
       continue
   ```

### Verification

To verify this works correctly:

```bash
# Test scenario 1: Process all datasets
python main.py --all --streaming --sample --sample-size 10

# Check checkpoints created
ls checkpoints/*_unified_checkpoint.json

# Test scenario 2: Simulate interruption and resume
python main.py --all --streaming --resume --sample --sample-size 5
# This will skip completed datasets and resume partial ones
```

### Important Notes

1. **No Global Checkpoint**: The system doesn't use a global checkpoint file. Each dataset is independent.

2. **Sequential IDs**: The main.py assigns sequential IDs (S1, S2, etc.) across all datasets, maintaining the correct sequence even when resuming.

3. **STT State**: When using `--enable-stt`, the STT processing state is preserved in checkpoints.

4. **Append Mode**: When using `--append`, the system correctly detects the last ID from HuggingFace and continues from there.

### Limitations and Recommendations

1. **Current Limitation**: If you interrupt during the upload phase (after processing but before upload completes), you might lose some processed samples. The checkpoint is saved after each upload batch.

2. **Recommendation**: For production use without `--sample`, consider:
   - Using smaller `--upload-batch-size` (e.g., 1000) for more frequent checkpoints
   - Monitoring the checkpoint files to track progress
   - Using `--verbose` flag to see detailed progress

### Example Commands

```bash
# Full processing with STT and resume capability
python main.py --all --streaming --enable-stt --resume

# With specific batch sizes for better checkpoint granularity
python main.py --all --streaming --enable-stt --resume \
    --streaming-batch-size 100 \
    --upload-batch-size 1000 \
    --stt-batch-size 32

# Monitor progress
watch -n 5 'ls -la checkpoints/*_unified_checkpoint.json'
```

## Conclusion

The checkpoint system is robust and handles multi-dataset processing with interruptions correctly. Each dataset maintains independent progress, and the `--resume` flag will correctly:
1. Skip completed datasets
2. Resume partially processed datasets from their last checkpoint
3. Start fresh on datasets that haven't been processed yet

This ensures seamless continuation of processing even after interruptions.
