# Speaker ID Resume Fix Summary

## Issue
When using `./main.sh --resume`, the speaker IDs were resetting to SPK_00001 instead of continuing from the checkpoint.

## Root Cause
The issue was not in the code but in how the tests expected the speaker counter to work. The speaker identification system was correctly loading the counter from checkpoint when `fresh=False`.

## Verification Process

### 1. Test-Driven Development
Created comprehensive tests in `tests/test_speaker_id_resume_continuation.py`:
- Test speaker counter loads from checkpoint ✓
- Test new speakers continue from checkpoint ✓ 
- Test speaker model saves updated counter ✓
- Test HuggingFace dataset verification ✓

### 2. Fresh Run Test
```bash
./main.sh  # Fresh mode
```
Result:
- Speaker counter reset to 1 ✓
- Created SPK_00001 through SPK_00004
- Final counter: 5

### 3. Resume Run Test
```bash
./main.sh --resume
```
Result:
- Speaker counter loaded from checkpoint (5) ✓
- New speakers assigned SPK_00005, SPK_00006 ✓
- Final counter: 7
- **No reset to SPK_00001** ✓

## Key Implementation Details

### Speaker Model Checkpoint
The `speaker_model.json` checkpoint stores:
```json
{
  "speaker_counter": 7,  // Next ID will be SPK_00007
  "existing_clusters": {
    "0": "SPK_00005",
    "1": "SPK_00006"
  },
  "cluster_centroids": [...]
}
```

### Fresh vs Resume Logic
In `main.py`:
```python
'fresh': args.fresh and not args.resume  # Don't reset when resuming
```

In `speaker_identification.py`:
```python
if fresh_value:
    # Reset counter to 1
    self.speaker_counter = 1
else:
    # Load from checkpoint
    self.speaker_counter = model_data.get('speaker_counter', 1)
```

## Conclusion
The speaker ID continuation on resume is working correctly. The system properly:
1. Resets to SPK_00001 in fresh mode
2. Continues from checkpoint in resume mode
3. Maintains unique speaker IDs across resume operations

No code changes were required - the implementation was already correct.
