# Task 6: Mozilla Common Voice Dataset Processor

## Objective
Implement a processor for the mozilla-foundation/common_voice_11_0 dataset, filter for Thai language content, and convert it to the standard schema.

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Research Mozilla Common Voice Dataset
- Examine the dataset structure on Huggingface (https://huggingface.co/datasets/mozilla-foundation/common_voice_11_0)
- Understand how to filter for Thai language content
- Identify the dataset's schema and audio format
- Determine if any special handling is required

### 2. Implement Mozilla Common Voice Processor Class
- Create a new class that inherits from BaseProcessor
- Implement all required methods:
  ```python
  class MozillaCommonVoiceProcessor(BaseProcessor):
      def __init__(self, config):
          super().__init__(config)
          # Initialize dataset-specific settings
          
      def process(self, checkpoint=None):
          # Load dataset
          # Filter for Thai content
          # Convert to standard schema
          # Yield processed samples
          
      def get_dataset_info(self):
          # Return dataset information
          
      def estimate_size(self):
          # Estimate dataset size
  ```

### 3. Implement Thai Language Filtering
- Load the dataset with the 'th' language filter if possible
- Otherwise, filter for entries where language is Thai after loading
- Log statistics about filtered data

### 4. Implement Schema Conversion
- Map Mozilla Common Voice fields to standard schema
- Generate sequential IDs (continuing from previous datasets if appending)
- Extract audio data and calculate length
- Extract transcript

### 5. Implement Streaming Processing
- Process the dataset in a streaming fashion to minimize memory usage
- Implement checkpointing for long-running processing
- Handle potential errors during processing

### 6. Add Logging and Progress Tracking
- Log detailed information about processing steps
- Track and report progress
- Log statistics about processed data

### 7. Implement Deduplication with VISTEC Common Voice TH
- Check if there's overlap between this dataset and the VISTEC Common Voice TH dataset
- Implement a strategy to avoid duplicates if necessary
- Log information about potential duplicates

## Acceptance Criteria
- MozillaCommonVoiceProcessor successfully filters for Thai language content
- Processor correctly converts to the standard schema
- Processing works in a streaming fashion
- Checkpointing allows resuming from interruptions
- Detailed logs are generated during processing
- Potential duplicates with VISTEC Common Voice TH are handled appropriately

## Dependencies
- Task 1: Project Setup
- Task 2: Dataset Processor Interface
- Task 5: VISTEC Common Voice TH Dataset Processor (for deduplication)

## Estimated Effort
- 5-7 hours
