# Task 7: Dataset Combination and Upload

## Objective
Implement functionality to combine processed datasets, handle ID generation, and upload the combined dataset to Huggingface.

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Implement Dataset Combination
- Create a function to combine datasets from multiple processors
- Handle sequential processing of datasets
- Implement ID generation logic:
  ```python
  def generate_ids(datasets, start_id=1):
      """Generate sequential IDs (S1, S2, ...) for combined datasets"""
      current_id = start_id
      for dataset in datasets:
          for sample in dataset:
              sample["ID"] = f"S{current_id}"
              current_id += 1
              yield sample
  ```

### 2. Implement ID Management for Append Mode
- Create functionality to determine the last ID in an existing dataset
- Implement logic to continue ID sequence when appending:
  ```python
  def get_last_id(dataset_name):
      """Get the last ID from an existing dataset"""
      # Load dataset and find the highest ID
      # Return the numeric part of the ID
  ```

### 3. Implement Huggingface Dataset Creation
- Create functions to build a Huggingface dataset from processed samples
- Implement dataset features definition
- Handle large dataset creation efficiently

### 4. Implement Huggingface Upload
- Create functions to upload the dataset to Huggingface
- Implement authentication using the token from hf_token.txt
- Handle upload errors and retries

### 5. Implement Progress Tracking and Logging
- Add detailed logging for the combination and upload process
- Implement progress tracking for long-running operations
- Create summary statistics for the combined dataset

### 6. Implement Validation
- Create validation functions to check the combined dataset
- Verify that all samples conform to the standard schema
- Check for any issues before uploading

## Acceptance Criteria
- Dataset combination works correctly
- ID generation produces sequential IDs (S1, S2, ...)
- Append mode correctly continues the ID sequence
- Huggingface dataset creation and upload work properly
- Progress tracking and logging provide detailed information
- Validation ensures dataset quality before upload

## Dependencies
- Task 1: Project Setup
- Task 2: Dataset Processor Interface
- Tasks 3-6: Individual Dataset Processors

## Estimated Effort
- 6-8 hours
