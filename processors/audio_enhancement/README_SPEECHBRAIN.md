# SpeechBrain Speaker Separation Implementation

## Overview

This implementation replaces the previous speaker separation system with a powerful SpeechBrain-based solution using the SepFormer model. It provides complete secondary speaker removal for voice cloning training datasets.

## Key Features

- **Complete Secondary Speaker Removal**: Uses SepFormer to completely separate and remove secondary speakers
- **GPU Accelerated**: Optimized for RTX 5090 with 32GB VRAM
- **Quality Validation**: Automatic rejection of poorly separated audio
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple files efficiently
- **Backward Compatibility**: Works with existing code

## Installation

```bash
# SpeechBrain is already included in requirements.txt
pip install speechbrain torchaudio pystoi torchmetrics
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from processors.audio_enhancement.speechbrain_separator import (
    SpeechBrainSeparator,
    SeparationConfig
)

# Configure separator
config = SeparationConfig(
    device="cuda",
    confidence_threshold=0.7,
    speaker_selection="energy"
)

# Initialize
separator = SpeechBrainSeparator(config)

# Process audio
result = separator.separate_speakers(audio_array, sample_rate=16000)

if not result.rejected:
    clean_audio = result.audio
    print(f"Confidence: {result.confidence}")
    print(f"Processing time: {result.processing_time_ms}ms")
else:
    print(f"Rejected: {result.rejection_reason}")
```

### Integration with Audio Enhancement Pipeline

The SpeechBrain separator is automatically used when you enable audio enhancement:

```bash
python main.py --fresh --all --sample --sample-size 10 \
    --enable-audio-enhancement --enhancement-level aggressive
```

### Configuration Options

```python
config = SeparationConfig(
    # Model settings
    model_name="speechbrain/sepformer-whamr16k",
    device="cuda",
    
    # Processing settings
    batch_size=16,  # Optimized for RTX 5090
    use_mixed_precision=True,
    
    # Quality thresholds
    confidence_threshold=0.7,
    quality_thresholds={
        "min_pesq": 3.5,
        "min_stoi": 0.85,
        "max_spectral_distortion": 0.15
    },
    
    # Speaker selection method
    speaker_selection="energy",  # or "embedding" for more accuracy
    
    # Performance settings
    chunk_duration=10.0  # Max chunk size for memory efficiency
)
```

## Speaker Selection Methods

### Energy-Based (Default)
- Selects the speaker with highest RMS energy
- Fast and works well for most cases
- Best when primary speaker is louder

### Embedding-Based
- Uses speaker embeddings to match with original
- More accurate but slower
- Better for similar volume speakers

### Hybrid
- Combines multiple criteria
- Most robust but slower
- Recommended for difficult cases

## Quality Metrics

The system calculates multiple quality metrics:

- **STOI**: Short-Time Objective Intelligibility (target: > 0.85)
- **Energy Ratio**: Preserved energy compared to original
- **Spectral Distortion**: Frequency domain changes (target: < 0.15)
- **SNR Improvement**: Signal-to-noise ratio improvement

## Performance

With RTX 5090 (32GB VRAM):
- Processing speed: ~50-100x real-time
- 100 samples (8 seconds each) in < 3 minutes
- Batch size up to 32 samples

## Troubleshooting

### Out of Memory Errors
```python
# Reduce batch size
config.batch_size = 8

# Disable mixed precision
config.use_mixed_precision = False
```

### Low Confidence Results
```python
# Try embedding-based selection
config.speaker_selection = "embedding"

# Lower confidence threshold
config.confidence_threshold = 0.6
```

### Poor Quality Results
```python
# Adjust quality thresholds
config.quality_thresholds = {
    "min_stoi": 0.80,  # Lower threshold
    "max_spectral_distortion": 0.20  # Higher tolerance
}
```

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
# Unit tests
python -m pytest tests/test_speechbrain_separator.py -v

# Integration tests
python -m pytest tests/test_speechbrain_integration.py -v

# Example script
python examples/test_speechbrain_separation.py [audio_file.wav]
```

## Model Details

### SepFormer (Separation Transformer)
- State-of-the-art speech separation model
- Trained on WHAMR! dataset (noisy + reverberant)
- Achieves 13.7 dB SI-SNRi improvement
- Handles overlapping speech effectively

### ECAPA-TDNN (Speaker Embeddings)
- Used for speaker verification
- Trained on VoxCeleb dataset
- Provides robust speaker representations

## Migration from Old System

The new system is backward compatible:

```python
# Old code still works
from processors.audio_enhancement.speaker_separation import SpeakerSeparator
separator = SpeakerSeparator(old_config)
result = separator.separate_speakers(audio, sr)

# But prefer new import
from processors.audio_enhancement.speechbrain_separator import SpeechBrainSeparator
separator = SpeechBrainSeparator(new_config)
result = separator.separate_speakers(audio, sr)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always validate results**: Check confidence scores and quality metrics
2. **Use appropriate enhancement level**: `aggressive` or `ultra_aggressive` for secondary speaker removal
3. **Monitor GPU memory**: Adjust batch size based on available VRAM
4. **Test on samples**: Use S3 and S5 samples to verify effectiveness
5. **Save rejected files**: Analyze why files are rejected to improve settings

## Known Limitations

1. **Single GPU only**: Currently doesn't support multi-GPU
2. **Fixed sample rate**: Expects 16kHz audio (resamples automatically)
3. **Memory intensive**: Long audio files may need chunking
4. **Language agnostic**: Not optimized specifically for Thai

## Future Improvements

1. Multi-GPU support for larger batches
2. Thai-specific fine-tuning
3. Real-time streaming mode
4. Advanced post-processing options
